#REAL/FAKE JOB POSTING PREDICTION
In this project I have used fake job posting dataset.(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i0a_VwSa_RTBLIQ-qEEb9oM6UozILzf2/view?usp=drive_link)
This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
On this dataset I have performed basic EDA and ANN(Artificial Neural Networking).
And after appying Artificial Neural Networking and normalizing it I got the accuracy of 91%.
