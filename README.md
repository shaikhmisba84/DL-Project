#REAL/FAKE JOB POSTING PREDICTION(DL Project)
In this project I have used fake job posting dataset.
This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
On this dataset I have performed EDA, Sampling Technique and ANN(Artificial Neural Networking) .
